# Inputs integers a and b.

# Note: Always use int(raw_input()) or float(raw_input()) for numerical input,
# since input() is much slower and does not always work with online judges.

# Note: For competition-style problems,
# do not prompt the user to enter an input
# (when using raw_input(), do not put a string in the brackets for output).
a = int(raw_input() )
b = int(raw_input() )

# Outputs sum.

# Note: For competition-style problems,
# do not use any extra words to create a statement.
# Only output the actual answer and nothing else.
print a + b
